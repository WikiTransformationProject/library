# Markdown-based knowledge repository: AI for Beginners (Sample)

This repository is a sample source for WikiTraccs for Markdown. It can be **published to SharePoint Online**.

It's a copy of https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners with some adjustments:

- subfolders unrelated to Markdown have been removed
- the filename of some images needed to be shortened, otherwise Windows would complain...
- some metadata has been added for WikiTraccs for Markdown, e.g. space metadata or de-duplicated page titles
