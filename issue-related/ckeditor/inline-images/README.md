Repro for [Modern pages with text web parts upgraded from CKEditor v4 to v5 lose image positioning](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sharepoint-developer/modern-pages-with-text-web-parts-upgraded-from-ckeditor-v4-to-v5/m-p/3927312).

## What does it do?

This script creates a modern SharePoint page with a text web part. This text web part uses CKEditor v4.

The text web part has 4 inline images, which reference 4 image web parts. Those image web parts all point to the same image file.

The image file will be uploaded to the SiteAssets library.

The resulting page should display three images in one row, next to each other. Three adjacent images. This is possible by left aligning all images, except the last one, which is right aligned.

And there is one trick: the fourth image is centered, which prevents the text from floating between the images. The centered image, which has a size of 1 pixel, acts as a "floatbreaker".

## How to use

* clone the repo
* set the "current directory" to the script path (so that the image can be found)
* enter the URL of a SharePoint site to test with
* run the script
* authenticate with SharePoint

The script should create a modern page with images.
